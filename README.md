# Instructions

* The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.)

* Each timeblock contains an input field and save button

* Clicking a time block's save button saves the input text to local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour
